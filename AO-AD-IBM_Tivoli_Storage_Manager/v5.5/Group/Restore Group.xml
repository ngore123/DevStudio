Parameters Description:

Command Arguments Description:

source-filespec[Required]
	Specifies the virtual file space name (enclosed in braces) and the group name on the server that you want to restore.

dest-filespec[Optional]
	Specifies the path where you want to place the group or one or more group members. If you do not specify a destination, the client restores the files to their original location.

Command Options Description:	

fromnode[Optional]
	The fromnode option permits one node to perform commands for another node. A user on another node must use the set access command to permit you to query, restore, or retrieve files or images for the other node.
	
inactive[Optional]
	Use the inactive option to display both active and inactive objects:	
	
pitdate[Optional]
	Use the pitdate option with the pittime option to establish a point in time for which you want to display or restore the latest version of your backups. Files or images that were backed up on or before the date and time you specified, and which were not deleted before the date and time you specified, are processed. Backup versions that you create after this date and time are ignored. Date should be entered in MM/DD/YYYY format.
Note: When pitdate is used, the inactive and latest options are implicit.

pittime[Optional]
	Use the pittime option with the pitdate option to establish a point in time for which you want to display or restore the latest version of your backups. Files or images that were backed up on or before the date and time you specify, and which were not deleted before the date and time you specify, are processed. Backup versions that you create after this date and time are ignored. This option is ignored if you do not specify pitdate option. Time should be entered in HH:MM:SS format.
Note: pitdate/pittime options can not be used with fromdate/fromtime options.
Note: The PITTIME option cannot be used without specifying the PITDATE option

fromdate[Optional]              
	Use the fromdate option with the fromtime option to specify a date and time from which you want to search for backups or archives during a restore, retrieve, or query operation. Files that were backed up or archived before this date and time are not included, although older directories might be included, if necessary, to restore or retrieve the files.

fromtime[Optional]              
	Use the fromtime option with the fromdate option to specify a beginning time from which you want to search for backups or archives during a restore, retrieve, or query operation. Tivoli Storage Manager ignores this option if you do not specify the fromdate option.

ifnewer[optional]
	The ifnewer option replaces an existing file with the latest backup version only if the backup version is newer than the existing file. Only active backups are considered unless you also use the inactive or latest options.

latest[Optional]
	Use the latest option with the following commands to restore the most recent backup version of a file, even if the backup is inactive.

replace[optional]
	The replace option specifies whether to overwrite existing files on your workstation, or to prompt you for your selection when you restore or retrieve files.
Valid values-
Prompt
    For nonscheduled operations, you are asked whether to overwrite existing files. For scheduled operations, existing files are not overwritten and no prompts are displayed. This is the default.

 All
    All existing files are overwritten, including read-only files. All locked files are replaced when the system is rebooted. If access to a file is denied, you are prompted to skip or overwrite the file. No action is taken on the file until there is a response to the prompt.

Yes
   Existing files are overwritten, except read-only files. For nonscheduled operations, you are asked whether to overwrite  existing read-only files. For scheduled operations, existing read-only files are not overwritten and no prompts are displayed. If access to a file is denied, the file is skipped.

No
   Existing files are not overwritten. No prompts will be displayed.

showmembers[Optional]
	Use the showmembers option with the following commands to display all members of a group.

Note: Although user can provide any of the above values however since this adapter does not support prompt handling at the moment, it is advisable to provide either “yes” or “no” here as the value.

skipntpermissions[optional]
	The skipntpermissions option bypasses processing of NTFS security information. Select this option for incremental backups, selective backups, archives, retrieves and restores. Valid values – yes,no(default)

skipntsecuritycrc[Optional]
	The skipntsecuritycrc option controls the computation of the security cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for a comparison of NTFS security information during an incremental or selective backup, archive, restore, or retrieve operation. If you set the
skipntsecuritycrc option to no (the default), performance might be slower because the program must retrieve all the security descriptors. Valid values – yes,no(Default)

todate[Optional]
	Use the todate option with the totime option to specify an ending date and time to which you want to search for backups or archives during a restore, retrieve, or query operation. For example, you might request a list of files that were backed up before 11:59 PM on June 30, 2002.

totime[Optional]
	Use the totime option with the todate option to specify an ending date and time to which you want to search for backups or archives during a restore, retrieve, or query operation. For example, you might request a list of files that were backed up before 11:59 PM on June 30, 2003. Tivoli Storage Manager ignores this option if you do not specify the todate option.</description>
